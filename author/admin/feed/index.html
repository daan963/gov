<p><strong>Jahangirnagar University:</strong>&nbsp;Progressive students of Jahangirnagar University (JABI) staged a protest march and human chain in support of the half-hour hartal called by the Left Democratic Alliance across the country to protest the announcement of the schedule for the upcoming National Assembly elections. &nbsp;</p>



<p>On Thursday (November 16) at 11:30 a.m., they staged a protest in front of the university&#8217;s main gate (Dairy Gate) adjacent to the Dhaka-Aricha highway.</p>



<p>When the police came and stopped the protest, the students formed a human chain there.&nbsp;At this time, the presence of the leaders and activists of the university branch of the Chhatra League can be seen beside the protest march. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Alif Mahmud, convenor (part) of the Student Union University Parliament said, &#8216;This university runs on public tax money.&nbsp;People give money because the students will come out and become bureaucrats, lawyers, politicians.&nbsp;They will later serve these people.&nbsp;Historically, this country has never had a fair election under the government.&nbsp;None of the 1996 elections, 2014 or 2018 elections were fair.&nbsp;Elections will not be fair under this fascist government.&nbsp;A dictator has never survived in this country.&nbsp;Dictatorship Ayub Khan could not survive, dictatorship Ershad could not survive this fascist government will not survive.&nbsp;&#8216;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="http://bnpub.banglanews24.com/public/userfiles/images/Shimul%20Hasan/Sml1/SML34/SML35/SML36/SML%2037/SML%2038/SML%2039/SML%2040/SML%2041/SML%2042/SML%2043/SML%2044/SML%2045/SML%2046/SML%2047/SML%2048/SML%2049/SML%2050/SML%2051/SML%2052/SML%2053/SML%2054/SML%2055/SML56/SML%2057/SML%2058/SML%2059/SML60/dsgfag.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>General Secretary of Samajtantrik Sramik Front Savar-Ashulia Jiban Ahmed said yesterday we saw an illegal Election Commission&#8217;s undemocratic schedule announcement.&nbsp;This schedule declaration is completely illegal, undemocratic.&nbsp;We will see another election like the last 2018 election and the one before that.&nbsp;We do not want this election.&nbsp;We have always said that elections should be held under a non-partisan caretaker government.&nbsp;Elections have never been fair under this government.&nbsp;So today we stand up for my right to vote.&nbsp;for our survival.&nbsp;Give us back our right to vote.&nbsp;Today commodity prices rise.&nbsp;Our program is to bring down the syndicate of this government. &nbsp;</p>



<p>He further said, &#8220;But the police stopped us today by blocking the start of our protest march.&#8221;&nbsp;We cannot be stopped.&nbsp;Because this movement is a fight for our survival.&nbsp;We are standing here for our survival.</p>



<p>Former General Secretary of Samajtantrik Chhatra Front, Kanoj Kanti Roy, also spoke at the human chain, organized by Jabi branch of Samajtantrik Chhatra Front, Sohagi Samia. &nbsp;</p>



<p>However, denying the fact of obstructing the procession, Ashulia police station officer-in-charge SM Kamruzzaman said, we did not obstruct anyone.&nbsp;They came, they left in human chains.</p>
